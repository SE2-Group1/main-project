# Technical Debt Strategy

## Improving Code Quality

1. **Enhance Quality Testing**
   - Maintain test coverage of at least **80%**.
   - Implement and enforce **quality gates** in pull requests to ensure high standards.

2. **Implement Peer Code Reviews**
   - Establish peer code reviews as a standard practice.
   - Encourage reviewers to focus not only on functionality but also on:
     - **Readability**
     - **Maintainability**
     - **Proper documentation**

3. **Enforce Review Guidelines**
   - Train and encourage reviewers to evaluate code quality thoroughly.
   - Standardize review processes to align with team best practices.

4. **Refine Task Time Estimation**
   - Avoid underestimating time needed for quality implementation.
   - Allocate sufficient time for technical debt management tasks.

## Paying Back Technical Debt

1. **Adopt Cost/Benefit Analysis**
   - Prioritize addressing technical debt based on:
     - **High benefit**
     - **Low cost**
   - Tackle high-impact issues first to maximize productivity.

2. **Integrate into Sprint Planning**
   - Include technical debt analysis and management as part of **sprint planning**.
   - Recompute technical debt analysis **weekly** to keep the backlog current.

3. **Assign Ownership**
   - Designate specific team members to **track and prioritize** technical debt.
   - Ensure these members are responsible for reporting and recommending fixes.

4. **Improve Documentation**
   - Maintain **proper documentation** to minimize the risk of future technical debt.
   - Document lessons learned from past projects to avoid repeating mistakes.

5. **Learn from Past Mistakes**
   - Use retrospectives to identify root causes of accumulated technical debt.
   - Develop processes to prevent recurrence of similar issues.
